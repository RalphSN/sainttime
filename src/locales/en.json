      "question1": "Why do I see the message 'Developer Mode must be enabled' when opening the app?",
      "answer1": "If your device is running iOS 16, go to Settings > Privacy & Security, scroll to the bottom, and enable Developer Mode. After enabling it, restart your device, and then try opening the app again.",
      "question2": "Which operating systems support Sideloadly?",
      "answer2": "Sideloadly runs on Windows 7, 8, 10, and 11. For optimal performance, Windows 10 or later is recommended. It also runs on macOS 10.12 Sierra and later, with macOS Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, or later recommended for best performance.",
      "question3": "Why doesn't Sideloadly detect my device?",
      "answer3": "If this happens, restart your PC, open iTunes while your device is connected, and ensure you tap 'Trust' on the popup from your iDevice. Then, open Sideloadly again. If the issue persists, try uninstalling and reinstalling iTunes.",
      "question4": "Do I need to jailbreak my device to install signed apps?",
      "answer4": "No. Whether using a certificate signature or an Apple ID signature, jailbreaking is not required for installation.",
      "question5": "Do I need to disable two-factor authentication on my Apple ID for signing?",
      "answer5": "No. You can sign IPA files whether two-factor authentication is enabled or not. However, if two-factor authentication is enabled, you will need to verify your Apple ID the first time, but not for subsequent uses.",
      "question6": "How long is the signed app valid?",
      "answer6": "IPA files signed with a certificate will work until the certificate expires. If the certificate is revoked before expiration, the app will no longer open ('signature revoked'). Apps installed using an Apple ID signature are valid for 7 days. After 7 days, you can re-download the app using the same Apple ID.",
      "question7": "How many apps can be installed?",
      "answer7": "On iOS 7, 8, and 9, you can install unlimited apps on your device. However, free developer accounts have limitations. On iOS 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and later, only three apps can be installed at the same time."
